{% label Programmer green %}
**Introduction**: *One Last Interview* is a 2D side-scrolling game project, which is my graduate thesis project. I served as the sole programmer in this project. The project has been submitted to the 2024 Tencent Game Creation Competition College Track and indiePlay China 2024.
**Main Work**: In the first two months of the project, I completed three prototype iterations, and finally, in two months, I used the 2D platform solution Corgi Engine as the core tool to complete all the development work in the demo. Many functions relied on components within the Corgi Engine, but most were modified and extended based on the original components to meet project needs (such as the "parry" function that the Corgi Engine does not have). I also took this opportunity to learn the architectural ideas of commercial engines.

<!-- timeline ### 3D Model Clipping Effect Based on Depth Testing -->
![](aabb.png)
**Introduction**: This was a task I received during my internship at ByteDance. In an app that scans real objects to generate 3D models, users may scan extra parts that need to be clipped and send the clipping data to the server.
**Main Work**: I was responsible for implementing the model clipping effect, user interaction logic, and cross-end message transmission. I used the AABB bounding box information of the model to draw the clipping box and applied materials, combined with depth testing and other graphics knowledge to achieve the special clipping effect given by the designer, and implemented the chain of listening to client messages and sending clipping information.
